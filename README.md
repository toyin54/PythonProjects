Project 1 - WebScraping.ipynb
In this project, i wanted to learn about web scraping in python. I have created a fucntion that ask the user to input an amazon product URL's , the funtion will then look for the product name and price and append it to an excell file. This is my inital practice but i want to increase the scale , getting more data from the webpage , tracking price changes , sending update emails to a specified address.
