This repository is mainly for Data Analysis projects in Python.
In this repository, I want to show my expereicne anfd continued development and understanding of Data Analysis tools in python.
Example of projects would be ,web scraping , cleaning data and creating visuailizations.



Project 1 - FuelList Api
In this project, I wanted to get a grasp of using API's in python. I was provided with the link of an API where I could get access to a list of all the alternative fuel stations. I created a function that lets me call specified parameters from that API. I can call on the api_key , fuel_type, country, limit, user_statis, and everChargerType. I wanted to play around with the data and answer some business questions related to Tesla electric charging stations within Canada. The project is still being worked and more complex queries will be run.

Project 2 - WebScraping.ipynb
In this project, i wanted to learn about web scraping in python. I have created a fucntion that ask the user to input an amazon product URL's , the funtion will then look for the product name and price and append it to an excell file. This is my inital practice but i want to increase the scale , getting more data from the webpage , tracking price changes , sending update emails to a specified address.
